## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Connectome-GNN-Suite seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to daniel@example.com with the following information:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- We will provide a detailed response within 7 days indicating next steps
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and disruptions to others
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not access, modify, or delete data belonging to others
- Contact us at daniel@example.com before making any public disclosure

## Security Considerations

### Data Handling

- Connectome data may contain sensitive neuroimaging information
- Always follow institutional data use agreements
- Implement appropriate access controls for datasets
- Consider de-identification requirements

### Model Security

- Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Implement proper authentication for model serving endpoints
- Secure model artifacts and training data
- Monitor for adversarial attacks on deployed models

### Dependencies

- Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities
- Use `pip-audit` or similar tools to scan for vulnerable packages
- Pin dependency versions in production environments

## Best Practices

1. **Data Privacy**: Follow HIPAA, GDPR, and relevant data protection regulations
2. **Access Control**: Implement role-based access for sensitive datasets
3. **Encryption**: Use encryption for data at rest and in transit
4. **Monitoring**: Log and monitor access to sensitive data and models
5. **Incident Response**: Have a plan for responding to security incidents
