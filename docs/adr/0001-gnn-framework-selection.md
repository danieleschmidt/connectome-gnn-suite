# ADR-0001: Graph Neural Network Framework Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Connectome-GNN-Suite requires a robust, scalable graph neural network framework to handle large-scale brain connectivity data (100B+ edges). We need to choose between several available frameworks:

- PyTorch Geometric (PyG)
- Deep Graph Library (DGL) 
- Graph Nets (TensorFlow)
- Custom implementation

Key requirements:
- Support for massive graphs (>100k nodes, >100M edges)
- Memory-efficient operations
- GPU acceleration
- Active community and maintenance
- Integration with PyTorch ecosystem
- Hierarchical graph support

## Decision
We choose **PyTorch Geometric (PyG)** as our primary GNN framework.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Excellent integration with PyTorch ecosystem
- Strong community support and active development
- Comprehensive collection of GNN layers and utilities
- Built-in support for large graph handling via sampling
- Extensive documentation and examples
- Memory-efficient sparse operations
- Support for heterogeneous and temporal graphs

### Negative
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with PyG
- Some advanced features may require custom implementations
- Dependency on PyTorch ecosystem (though this aligns with our stack)

## Alternatives Considered

### Deep Graph Library (DGL)
- **Pros:** Multi-framework support, good performance
- **Cons:** More complex API, less integrated with our PyTorch workflow

### Graph Nets (TensorFlow)
- **Pros:** Google backing, good for production
- **Cons:** TensorFlow ecosystem doesn't align with our PyTorch choice

### Custom Implementation
- **Pros:** Full control, optimized for our specific use case
- **Cons:** High development cost, maintenance burden, reinventing the wheel
